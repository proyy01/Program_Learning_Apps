<!-- HTML is the computer language that structures all the web pages on the internet. It stands for Hypertext Markup Language. -->

<!-- To create a button, we use <button>Like</button> . These are called HTML tags. Try it yourself. -->
<button>Like</button>

<!-- Most HTML tags come in a pair, they have an opening tag and a closing tag.
Opening tags are surrounded by <> , while closing tags are surrounded by </> . Try putting the tags in the correct order. -->

<!-- The text that comes between the opening and closing tags is what will appear on the button itself. -->

<!-- Create a button that displays the letter Q. -->
<button>Q</button>

<!-- Create a button that displays the letter R. -->
<button>R</button>

<!-- Create a button that displays the letter D. -->
<button>D</button>

<!-- Awesome! We've learned how to create the structure of a button.
Before we add actions to them, move on to the next lesson to learn about an HTML element present on every web page out there. -->



<!-- In HTML, the keywords of some tags are obvious, but there are some tags that use a shortened form. For example, we use p for a paragraph. -->
<p></p>

<!-- Coding a paragraph is very similar to coding a button. You need an opening tag, followed by your text, and a closing tag.
Code a paragraph that displays Mimo is Fun!. -->
<p>Mimo is Fun!</p>

<!-- We can create headings in HTML to emphasize certain texts. There are 6 sizes of heading in HTML, from h1 to h6. -->
<h1></h1>
<h2></h2>
<h3></h3>
<h4></h4>
<h5></h5>
<h6></h6>

<!-- Code a heading that displays SnapCat. -->
<h1>SnapCat</h1>

<!-- The heading tag emphasizes texts by making them bigger and bolder. h1 is the biggest and boldest and h6 is the smallest and least bold. -->

<!-- Code a heading with opening and closing h6 tags. -->
<h6>This is a heading in h6, smallest, least boldest</h6>

<!-- Code the opening tag for the biggest heading. -->
<h1>This is a heading in h1, biggest, boldest</h1>

<!-- Code the opening tag for the second biggest heading. -->
<h2>This is a heading in h2, one scale down</h2>

<!-- End of the first lesson! -->
