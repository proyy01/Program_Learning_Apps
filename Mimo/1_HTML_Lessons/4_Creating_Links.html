<!-- href is an attribute. All attributes have two things in common: they provide extra information and they go inside the opening tag. -->
<!-- Attributes are added after the name of the tag, and before the > closing sign. -->
<!-- We link to a webpage by adding = after the attribute and a URL as a value in between quotes. -->
