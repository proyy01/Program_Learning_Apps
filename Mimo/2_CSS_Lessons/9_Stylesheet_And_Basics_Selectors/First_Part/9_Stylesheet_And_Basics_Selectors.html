<!-- We'll now move on to making great-looking websites with the help of a styling language called CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets. -->

<!-- To make larger webpages more manageable, we can move our CSS to a style sheet, or a special file just for styling the webpage. -->
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Water Puns</h1>
        <p>Why does water never laugh at jokes? It's not a fan of dry humor.</p>
    </body>
</html>

<!-- To include a style sheet in an HTML file, we use the link element. <link> is a self-closing empty element and it goes inside the head element. -->

<!-- To know what kind of file to include, the opening link tag needs the rel attribute set using rel="stylesheet". -->

<!-- To specify the style sheet's location, set the href attribute to "style.css". -->

<!-- What does the href attribute do in this piece of code? (The one at the beginning of this html file)-->
<!-- Answer: It allows the link element to find the style sheet. -->
