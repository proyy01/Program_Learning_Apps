<!-- Welcome to the Linktree project! Here, you'll build your personal landing page (similar to the famous link-in-bio link trees.) -->
<!-- Let's start with the HTML. -->

<!-- Add an h1 element with your name between the opening and closing tags. -->
<h1>Benjamin Rozas</h1>

<!-- Now that we've created our first HTML element, let's add another one. -->
<!-- Below the h1 element, create an h2 element. Add text that describes you to the h2 element. -->
<h2>Graduate in English Linguistics and Literature</h2>

<!-- Fantastic! We now need some text to welcome the visitors to the page. -->
<!-- Below the h2 element, create a p element. Then, inside the p element, add a welcome message. -->
<p>Welcome!</p>

<!-- Let's continue by creating our first-ever link to another website. -->
<!-- Below the p element, create a link element by using the a tag. Inside the a element, add text to a website you would want to link to, like your Instagram or TikTok, for example. -->
<!-- To make the links work, we need to add the href attribute. This attribute allows us to specify the website we want to link to. -->
<!-- The href attribute needs a value as well, which we'll add in between quotation marks. -->
<!-- Inside all your opening a tags, code href="". Inside the quotation marks from href, add a link to any websites you want. -->
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-rozas-0315bb2a9/">LinkedIn</a>
<br>
<a href="https://github.com/proyy01">GitHub</a>

<!-- Let's add a personal flair by adding an image as well. -->
<!-- At the top of the page, right above the h1 element, add an img element. -->
<!-- Inside the img element, add the src attribute with a link to an image of your choosing from one of your personal profiles, for example. -->
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ukVeyks.png">
<!-- Personal note: This should be above the h1 tag, but since this a file to track progress, it will be placed here for now. -->

<!-- As we now have an image, we need to ensure it doesn't break the page layout. -->
<!-- Set the width to a value that looks good. -->
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ukVeyks.png" width="100">

<!-- Congrats! You've completed the Linktree project -->
