<!-- An element is what we call the opening tag, closing tag, and code in between. -->
<!-- Which one of these is an element? -->
<!-- Answer: <button>Hello, World!</button> -->

<!-- Code an h1 element that displays My Online Store. -->
<h1>My Online Store</h1>

<!-- To create a webpage, you'll need an opening and closing HTML tag. Which one of these options will create an empty HTML webpage? -->
<!-- Answer: <html></html> -->

<!-- Create a webpage by coding an html element. -->
<!-- Remember we can create an html element by coding <html> and </html>. -->
<html>
</html>

<!-- The html and body elements form the structure of a webpage. We place elements we want to display inside of the body. -->
<!-- Later, we'll learn about other elements that go inside of <html> </html> to give webpages style and make them interactive. -->
<html>
    <body>

    </body>
</html>

<!-- We must place contents, such as headings, inside the body tags. Display a heading on the webpage. -->
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>Top Stories</h1>
    </body>
</html>

<!-- Code the opening tag to display a button on the webpage. -->
<html>
    <body>
        <button>Add to Cart</button>
    </body>
</html>

<!-- Display a paragraph underneath the heading on the webpage. -->
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I love to code</p>
    </body>
</html>

<!-- Display the larger heading on top of the smaller heading. -->
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>Online Store</h1>
        <h6>Shoes</h6>
    </body>
</html>

<!-- First part of the fifth lesson finished! -->

<!-- The head HTML element, <head></head>, is a container for information about a webpage, like its title. It goes before the body tag. -->
<html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>My favourite things</h1>
        <p>Raindrops on <em>roses</em><br> Whiskers on <strong>kittens</strong></p>
    </body>
</html>

<!-- The title of a webpage appears in the tab or window of the web browser. -->
<!-- To give a webpage a title, we add <title> and </title> inside the head tags. -->
<!-- Note that the title is not visible but it provides information to the browser. -->
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My webpage</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>My favourite things</h1>
        <p>
            Raindrops on <em>roses</em><br>
            Whiskers on <strong>kittens</strong>
        </p>
    </body>
</html>

<!-- The doctype tells the web browser what version of HTML we're using. Without it, the browser might not display the page correctly. -->
<!-- Since we're using the latest version, we use <!doctype html>. -->
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My webpage</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>My favourite things</h1>
        <p>
            Raindrops on <em>roses</em><br>
            Whiskers on <strong>kittens</strong>
        </p>
    </body>
</html>

<!-- The doctype looks like an empty doctype tag with an empty html attribute: <!doctype html>. -->
<!-- Attributes provide additional information to tags. You'll learn more about them in later chapters. -->
