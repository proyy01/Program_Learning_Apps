<!-- HTML is the computer language that structures all the web pages on the internet. It stands for Hypertext Markup Language. -->

<!-- To create a button, we use <button>Like</button> . These are called HTML tags. Try it yourself. -->
<button>Like</button>

<!-- Most HTML tags come in a pair, they have an opening tag and a closing tag.
Opening tags are surrounded by <> , while closing tags are surrounded by </> . Try putting the tags in the correct order. -->

<!-- The text that comes between the opening and closing tags is what will appear on the button itself. -->

<!-- Create a button that displays the letter Q. -->
<button>Q</button>

<!-- Create a button that displays the letter R. -->
<button>R</button>

<!-- Create a button that displays the letter D. -->
<button>D</button>

<!-- Awesome! We've learned how to create the structure of a button.
Before we add actions to them, move on to the next lesson to learn about an HTML element present on every web page out there. -->
